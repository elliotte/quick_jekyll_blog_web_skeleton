From one dataset EAMLI generates full financial forecasts, discounted cash-flows, scenario and impact based modelling and multiple business valuations.

Machine learning algorithims are applied to our scenario based modelling engine that seek out business driver decisions that yield greater business value.  

Our engine defines the outputs quantatively against base case scenarios to empower business or advisory decision making.

**Use Case 1**

Normally Founders would have to pay excess of £30,000 to access financial modelling and reporting to satisfy investor due-dilgence before paying over the monies.

ScaleUp companies can now access this material at feasible cost.   

Using EAMLI you can produce more robust financial models and business metric reporting sets for less than £10,000.

Normally applicable to companies trying to raise more than £2,000,000 growth capital.

**Use Case 2**

Small to medium sized accountancy firms normally draw sword against the larger accountancy firms within the auditing arena.

Often they lose out when their auditing customer trys to raise £10-50m of debt financing for growth or acquisitions.

Economics of scale within the larger practices mean they have the teams with the skills and knowledge to maintain the masses of Excel financial models required to comply with corporate banking credit checks or investor due diligence at this scale. 

EAMLI can empower SME accountancy firms to compete within a more lucrative corporate finance market.

**Use Case 3**

Bad decisions dominate S&P500 business to small and medium sized businesses.
