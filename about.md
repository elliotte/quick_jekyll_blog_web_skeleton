Let's get to the technicals before we talk about the birth of EAMLI.

`what is it?`

EAMLI is the worlds most advanced financial forecasting, modelling and business decision making tool.

The tool is Excel based, with the data input sheet sending the information to our servers where our calc engine returns a data cube to the Excel workbook.  

The workbook has pre-populated reporting templates that automatically update from the data cube.

From one input dataset EAMLI generates full financial forecasts, discounted cash-flows, scenario and impact based modelling and multiple business valuations.

Basic output reports include business metric and KPI reporting outside of a traditional profit and loss, balance sheet and cash-flow approach.

Data inputs are business driver based and output reporting is fully customisable due to segmentation input design.

You can download an example model [here](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll)

`what can it be used for?`

The reporting outputs have multiple use cases for investment analysts, accountants or business advisors.  

*Accountancy types*

- M&A transaction advisory
- Corporate debt financing
- Business recovery planning
- Business budgeting
- Business decision-making and advisory

*Investment types*

- pre-Series A and post-Series A business valuations
- scenario based financial forecasting
- Venture Capital or Private Equity financial modelling

`the technical crux for financial modellers`

Forget maintaining multiple excel based workbooks and running simulations overnight.  Forget human based financial control checks on error prone Excel spreadsheets.  We handle that in our backend and provide a full traceable data cube for auditing and due-diligence purposes.

You can build up multiple business scenarios and models using the one data input sheet.  

Build a base case business scenario and receive full financial output reports includinfg DCFs, simulations and business metrics.

Plug in a different scenario such as a different pricing strategy or an extra subsidary business acquisition, and receive the additional financial outputs overlayed on top of the base case model.

Compare multiple business scenarios quantatively for effective decision making.

`the technical crux for Founders`

Get your advisors to use this tool and force them to quantatively define your business drivers into our data input, which in turn will be a challenging learning experience for you as a Founder, but a hugely valuable excerise and ouputs
